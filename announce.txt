The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* libicu56-56.1-1
* libicu-devel-56.1-1
* icu-doc-56.1-1

libicu55 is now obsolete.  Package maintainers, please rebuild any packages that depend on it when you get a chance.

ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.  ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.
