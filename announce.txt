The following packages have been updated in the Cygwin distribution:

* libicu54
* libicu-devel
* icu-doc

libicu48 (32-bit) and libicu51 (64-bit) are now obsolete.  Package maintainers, please rebuild any packages that depend on them.

ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.  ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.
