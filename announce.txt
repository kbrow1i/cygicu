Subject: icu 60.2-1

The following packages have been uploaded to the Cygwin distribution:

* libicu60-60.2-1
* libicu-devel-60.2-1
* icu-doc-60.2-1

ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing
Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.  ICU is
widely portable and gives applications the same results on all
platforms and between C/C++ and Java software.

This is an update to the latest upstream release.  It is the first
non-test Cygwin release that incorporates some major changes that were
made upstream starting with icu-59.1.  The changes make ICU easier to
use but require changes in projects using ICU.  In particular, ICU now
requires C++11, so packages using ICU may need to add -std=c++11 or
-std=gnu++11 to CXXFLAGS.  See

for further details.
